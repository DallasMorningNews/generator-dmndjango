# generator-dmndjango [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]
Yeoman generator for use in django projects at _The Dallas Morning News_.

Creates a gulp-based staticapp for rendering scss, js and responsive image sets into the static files directory of a django app created using the [django-project-template](https://github.com/DallasMorningNews/django-project-template).

## Installation

Be sure you have the same dependencies installed as needed by [generator-dmninteractives](https://github.com/DallasMorningNews/generator-dmninteractives/wiki/Setting-up-your-computer#dependencies).

Then install generator-dmndjango using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```bash
$ npm install -g generator-dmndjango
```

## Generating the staticapp

Move to the `staticapp` directory created by the DMN django [app template](https://github.com/DallasMorningNews/django-project-template#using-the-app-template).

Then generate the app:

```bash
$ yo dmndjango
```

The generator will ask for the app name you used when creating your django app and for which module pattern you'd like to use, which will determine which subgenerator builds the app. (Currently supports CommonJS and ES6.)

## Using the staticapp

Simply run gulp in the `staticapp` directory while developing your django project. Any changes made to javascript and scss files will be automatically rendered into your app's local static file directory. (Presumes your app's static directory is structured like this: `<your_app>/static/<your_app>/<js/css/img>/`.)

```bash
$ gulp
```

### JS

The ES6 and CommonJS patterns bundle any javascript files prefixed with `main-`, allowing you to create multiple bundles for different Django views.

To uglify scripts, run:

```bash
gulp --production
```

### SCSS

Support for SCSS, only.

### IMG

Images must be processed explicitly by running:

```bash
$ gulp img
```

## ES6

The ES6 subgenerator includes browserify JSX and ES6 babel transforms for use with React/Redux. It also includes airbnb's eslint config.

#### Atom linter known issue:

If you're using Atom's `linter-eslint`, you will experience errors if Atom is not opened at the staticapp root directory. See this [open issue](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint/issues/422). We generally open a second project folder at the staticapp root to get around the issue.
